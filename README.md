## Helo there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an IT student who loves linux and programming.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
* **[StreamChatMod](/mini-bomba/StreamChatMod)**, a modification for Minecraft (currently forge 1.8.9, fabric 1.16.5+ soonâ„¢) that adds any Twitch chat into the minecraft chat for easy access
* **EndermanBot** (ðŸ‘€ closed-source ðŸ‘€), a bot for Discord
* **[Create/Update Github Release](/marketplace/actions/create-update-github-release)**, a GitHub Action made for StreamChatMod (but you can use it too) that can manage a rolling `latest` prerelease
* ~~**[BarszczSosnowskiMod](/ZSPWrzesniaTeam/BarszczSosnowskiMod)**, a mod for minecraft that adds the Barszcz Sosnowskiâ„¢~~ nah just kidding, that project is a meme at this point

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
* Github Actions
* Minecraft modding
* Java

### ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘Œ I already know pretty well:
* Python
* Docker
* Linux (ðŸ‘€ from the user side, not developing the kernel ðŸ‘€)
* MySQL
* discord.py
* Lua/Luau/Roblox Lua

### ðŸ“« How to reach me:

* Whenever I stream on Twitch: [mini__bomba](https://twitch.tv/mini__bomba)
