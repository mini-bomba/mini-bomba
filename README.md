## Helo there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an IT student who loves linux and programming.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
* **[ajayyy's SponsorBlock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock)**, an extension for blocking sponsors & other unwanted segments from youtube videos. I often do debugging & bugfixes, sometimes I add a nice feature.
* **[DeArrow Browser](https://github.com/mini-bomba/DeArrowBrowser)**, an explorer for the [DeArrow](https://dearrow.ajay.app/) database as a single-page web application.  Inspired by [Lartza's SBbrowser](https://github.com/Lartza/SBbrowser).
* **[mini_bomba utils](https://github.com/mini-bomba/mini_bomba-utils)**, a collection of CLI utility scripts
* **[my userscripts](https://github.com/mini-bomba/uscripts)**, some useful, some just for funâ„¢

### My previous projects:
* **[InstalingPy](https://github.com/mini-bomba/InstalingPy)**, an API binding library and automation framework for instaling.pl
* **[github-webhook-proxy](https://github.com/mini-bomba/github-webhook-proxy)**, a webworker proxy for adding extra data to GitHub webhook embeds on Discord
* **[StreamChatMod](https://github.com/mini-bomba/StreamChatMod)**, a modification for Minecraft (currently forge 1.8.9, fabric 1.16.5+ soonâ„¢) that adds any Twitch chat into the minecraft chat for easy access
* **[EndermanBot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=676496144800415746&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdQw4w9WgXcQ&response_type=code&scope=bot)** (ðŸ‘€ closed-source ðŸ‘€), a bot for Discord
* **[Create/Update Github Release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-update-github-release)**, a GitHub Action made for StreamChatMod (but you can use it too) that can manage a rolling `latest` prerelease
* ~~**[BarszczSosnowskiMod](https://github.com/ZSPWrzesniaTeam/BarszczSosnowskiMod)**, a mod for minecraft that adds the Barszcz Sosnowskiâ„¢~~ this project wasn't really taken seriously

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
* Rust
* Grafana

### ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘Œ I already know pretty well:
* Python
* JavaScript (no frameworks)
* Docker/Podman
* Linux (ðŸ‘€ from the user/sysadmin side, not developing the kernel ðŸ‘€)
* MySQL/MariaDB
* discord.py
* Lua/Luau/Roblox Lua

### ðŸ“« How to reach me:
* On Discord directly: mini_bomba (though I will most likely deny your friend request)
* On Discord via [a server](https://minibomba.pro/rr#discord)
* On Matrix: [@mini_bomba:matrix.org](https://minibomba.pro/rr#matrix)
* maybe i'll set up an email address on my server soonâ„¢? (will probably never happen)
